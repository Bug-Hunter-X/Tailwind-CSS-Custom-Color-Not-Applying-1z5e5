# Tailwind CSS Custom Color Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using custom colors in Tailwind CSS.  The problem arises when a custom color is defined in `tailwind.config.js` but doesn't get applied in the HTML.  This often happens due to issues with the `content` array, typos in the color name, or incorrect configuration.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect configuration causing the problem, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.
